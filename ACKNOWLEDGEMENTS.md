Pathfinder AI is built on the shoulders of giants. This project would not be possible without the incredible work of the open-source community and the following key technologies.

## Core Technologies

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: The powerful React framework that enables our server-side rendering, API routes, and overall application structure.
- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: The foundational UI library for building our interactive components.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For providing static typing, which improves code quality and developer experience.

## AI & Backend

- **[Google's Gemini & Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)**: The core AI engine that powers all the intelligent features of the platform.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**: Provides the robust backend-as-a-service for our authentication (`firebase/auth`) and database (`firebase/firestore`) needs.

## UI & Styling

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build a modern and responsive design rapidly.
- **[ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: An incredible collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and reusable components that form the backbone of our user interface.
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)**: For the clean and consistent icon set used throughout the application.
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: While not a direct dependency, its influence on modern web animations and interactions has inspired our UI/UX approach.

## Tooling & Development

- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: For pioneering the development and hosting of Next.js applications, and for setting the standard in developer experience.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: The runtime that powers our development environment and server-side logic.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: For maintaining a consistent and high-quality codebase.

We extend our sincere gratitude to the maintainers and contributors of these projects. Your dedication makes projects like Pathfinder AI possible.
